##Under Assault Bracket Simulator

This program allows the user to either predict a fully automated bracket, or allows the user to control a Bracket,
chosing who wins what rounds, or choosing for that round to be simulated.

##Description
This program uses a switch statement and a simple Command Line Menu to allow the user to navigate throught their options. The user
can either Simulate the bracket, meaning they can choose who wins in each round, or stimulate each round, meaning they are selected
based of their player profiencies. The user can Predict a bracket, meaning they can predict who wins each round, then the bracket
will be simulated to see if they predicted correctly. The last option is to quit, just ending the program.

##To run
Nothing special is needed to run this program, not command line args or any extra steps, just the normal requirements for running
a java file
