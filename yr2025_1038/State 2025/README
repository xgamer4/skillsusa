# Predicting Firestorm's UnderAssualt

* Author: Nicole Prosser

## Overview

This program allows users to run various simulations of possible outcomes of the Firestorm UnderAssualt competition

## Compiling and Using

To compile and run, hit the arrow in the top right corner of vs code.

The user will be prompted to input a single letter command, representing the simulation the user wants the program to run. A menu with further instructions should appear to guide the user.

Depending on the chosen simulation, the user will be prompted to input the names of the teams they want to run the simmulation with.

## Discussion

Overall the project went rather smoothly. The hardest part was determining how to organize information, what should be its own objects, etc. I also had to remind myself on using the .equals function to compare strings instead of ==, but once I fixed that bug, everything ran pretty smoothly the only other issue that I faced was VS code throwing runtime errors at me for no apparent reason and having to switch devices twice. I really enjoyed this project, as it required a lot of planning and thought, but not overly complex code.


## Testing

For testing, I ran through the all the possible simulations, multiple times with mutliple different inputs ensuring all of them worked. If a bug occured, I would fix it and rerun the tests to ensure it had been fixed properly
